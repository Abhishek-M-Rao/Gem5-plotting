# Gem5-plotting
Project I worked on in SPARK Lab, for the experiments of cache configuration of ceaser cache with base, 1, 2, 4, and 16 partions to evaluate the performance of these difference cache replacement policies under 22 different benchmarks. Diff_stats script processes the 100, 1000, or however many samples there are under that benchmark for each cache configuration and pulls relative metrics about its performance such as the instructions per cycle in each detailed core, branch mispredict rate in each core, misses per kilo-instruction in the shared l3 cache (llc) and the llc-misses into a json file for each of the 22 benchmarks for each of the 5 different cache configurations. Then the allone_graph script takes in each of the rollup.json files and translates it into a pandas dataframe. Then using this dataframe, I grab the data I want to plt and find the geometric mean to plot into graphs for each statistic that show the cache configurations perforamnce on a said benchmark.
